 Inital thoughts 
Largest Number found was MMMCMXCIX 3,999. On the calculator website provided after 3999 They convert it to bracket notation so we can assume that Value is
the largest the program will have to handle
Program Objective: Convert Roman Numerals to Decimal Numbers and also decimal numbers to roman numerals
Only acceptable characters for roman numerals are I, V, X, L, C, D, M. 

Design Descions:
Every text input will be updated to capital form and then checked to see if they match one of those characters. at first instance that it
doesn't match it will break and we will then ask them to resubmit their input because input included incorrect characters. We could have the process run with while loop 
until it finishes running through text file input or user input.


I= 1 
V = 5 
X = 10  
L = 50  
C = 100  
D = 500  
M = 1000 

Follow rules  1,2,3 , and 4 on code challenge page for calculating the correct conversion of the item. and then follow

I'll be using C++ so I could potentiall have it be run through command line arguements taking in input file then output file. or just through user input through cin.
Potentially will include both as an option.
