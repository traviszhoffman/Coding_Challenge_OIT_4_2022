# Coding_Challenge_OIT_4_2022
Time wise the coding challenge took me all four hours.
I didn't finish implementing/ debugging all my code. If I had had more time I would finish debugging the
convert roman numerals to decimal function as it seems to give the correct value most of the time but in some cases it doesn't seem to be adding the very last number if 
the value is a 1. More than likely its an easy fix with an issue with my for loop/if statements that i could fix. I would have also finished implementing the program so thatyou could take an entire file and convert it to another text file with the results of your conversions. I would have also eddited my object that I was using for my class and implemented the convert decimal to roman numeral functions. I also did not have a chance yet to implement rule #4 in regards to what roman numerals are acceptable according to the document when checkingthe input thats received. I would have also moved my functions that were over 10 lines into my RomanNumeralConversion.cpp file and out of the header file. 

I would have also liked to store a BYU id number / user name of the person that is converting the file if they chose input file so that it would have their name displayed by their results.
